This Automator service simplifies adding a tracking number to [Junecloud's
Delivery Status][junecloud] to sync with your iOS devices. This service
allows you to select a tracking number (for example, from an Amazon.com
confirmation email), option-click on it, and select "Add Tracking Number to
Deliveries" from your Services menu. This will open the Junecloud sync
website and add your selected tracking number. Note, you will need a
Junecloud sync account for this to work.
